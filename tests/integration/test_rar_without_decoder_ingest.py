"""Integration: a RAR archive ingested on a machine with no RAR decoder.

The defect, as reported from a real Windows ingest:

    WARNING reader_file.readers.read_archive: RAR extraction unavailable for
    C:\\Users\\Solo\\Desktop\\...\\Deleted Items.rar: RarCannotExec
    ...
    Extraction failed        (stored as Unread, 0 words)

66.5 MB of evidence was recorded as unreadable, and nothing in the log said
that the only missing piece was an external binary. The extraction was
all-or-nothing: the first member that needed a decoder aborted the whole
archive, and the reader turned the exception into ``None``.

This test runs the real pipeline (reader -> router -> storage -> PostgreSQL)
with no decoder present, on an archive whose first member is compressed, and
asserts the stored outcome the operator sees:

* the archive is stored as ``partially_processed`` with a detail naming how
  many members could not be read and why - not ``processed`` (a claim that the
  whole archive was read) and not ``failed`` (which discards the members that
  were read);
* members that could be read are ingested as children with lineage;
* the archive's own manifest is searchable, so the container's listing is
  evidence even when its members are not;
* the condition is queryable after the run through
  ``paths.extraction_provenance -> 'diagnostics'``;
* every row reaches a terminal state.
