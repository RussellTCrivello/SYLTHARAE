"""Integration: the registry accounts for the application, and governs it.

This is where the architectural contract meets the real Flask application:

* every user-facing page it serves is owned by exactly one interface - a page
  added without a registry entry fails here, which is the guardrail;
* the request gate serves what an interface owns and refuses what nothing owns;
* dependencies are enforced when an operator switches something off, with an
  explanation rather than a silent broken configuration;
* resetting uses the registry's defaults, not "enable everything";
* a settings file written by an earlier version still works, and its choices
  reach the interfaces that replaced them.
