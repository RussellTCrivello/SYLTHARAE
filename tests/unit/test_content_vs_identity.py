"""Content and metadata must not be confused with one another.

Regression guards for a defect that came in with the identity/provenance work:
the flattened identity record (declared name and extension, detected format,
MIME type, discrepancies) was appended to the artifact's *content* text. A file
that yielded no content at all therefore looked readable - the skipped 20x20
icon in tests/integration/test_status_persisted.py was stored as
``file_status='Read'`` with 202 characters of "content" that were nothing but
labels such as ``Original name: icon.png`` - the word index gained ~10
boilerplate labels per artifact, and the labels were shown to the examiner as
though they were file content.

The identity record is still recorded per artifact (that is what the provenance
tests cover); what these tests pin is that it is recorded *as metadata*, and
that only real extracted content - including the readers' forensic text, which
is content - reaches the content channel.
