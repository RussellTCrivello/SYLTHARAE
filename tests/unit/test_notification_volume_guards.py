"""Volume/accuracy guards for the notification read paths.

These tests pin the structural answers to "are all precautions in place for
VERY large notification volumes?":

* No endpoint forces a full in-memory refresh on the request path (the old
  ``/stats`` and paginated routes refreshed on EVERY call, racing each
  other - the source of the "10 loaded" vs 5 rows mismatch - and re-read up
  to 10 000 rows from the DB per poll).
* No read path pulls an unbounded/capped-in-memory row window into Python
  to compute counts or pages (``LIMIT 10000`` + Python slicing); counts are
  SQL aggregates, pages are SQL LIMIT/OFFSET.
* ``per_page`` is clamped (the frontend asks for 1000; the server must not
  accept unbounded values).
* The scan endpoint performs at most a constant number of existence queries
  (no per-hash / per-file N+1 probes).
