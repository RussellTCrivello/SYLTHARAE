"""The record action surface: the join, the boundary, and the missing route.

Four things are protected here, and each of them is a defect that has already
happened once in this product:

* **The join is the only one.** A screen says what an action does *here*; the
  Action Registry says what the action *is*. A binding that names an unknown
  action, another screen's action, or a state reason the vocabulary does not
  have is refused rather than rendered as a guess.
* **The states stay apart.** ``no_selection`` and ``no_permission`` are not the
  same thing, a disabled action keeps its place with a reason, and a hidden one
  is not drawn at all. A product that collapses them into one grey button has
  lost information the reader needed.
* **"Not built" is not "available".** ``files.reprocess`` was declared, drawn,
  and pointed at ``/file/<id>/reprocess`` - a route that has never existed, so
  the link answered 404. It is now registered with ``visibility="not_built"``,
  refused by the state derivation, and reported by name.
* **The controls that ship lead somewhere.** ``bindings.check`` resolves every
  address a screen binds against the application's own URL map, so this class
  of defect fails a test instead of reaching a reader.
