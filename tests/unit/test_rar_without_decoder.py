"""Unit: RAR archives on a machine with no external decoder.

The defect this file guards (reported from a real Windows ingest):

    WARNING reader_file.readers.read_archive: RAR extraction unavailable for
    C:\\Users\\Solo\\Desktop\\...\\Deleted Items.rar: RarCannotExec
    ...
    Extraction failed        (stored as Unread, 0 words)

``rarfile`` is a front end for an external decoder, but it parses RAR4/RAR5
headers itself and reads members stored uncompressed without one. The old
extraction was all-or-nothing: the first member that needed the missing
decoder aborted the whole archive, the reader swallowed the exception into
``None``, and 66.5 MB of evidence was recorded as unreadable with no mention
that the only missing piece was a binary.

What must hold, and is asserted here:

* members that can be read without a decoder are extracted (stored members,
  RAR4 and RAR5) - a decoderless machine still reads part of the archive;
* a member needing a decoder is *counted, named and explained*, never dropped
  and never fatal to the rest of the archive;
* a partial read is reported as one (``decoder_missing`` + actionable detail),
  not as generic "Extraction failed";
* a damaged member is refused and its partial output removed, not published;
* an encrypted archive is reported as password-protected, a corrupt container
  as damaged, and neither as "no decoder";
* safety policy (traversal, file count, per-file size, allowed extensions)
  applies identically on this path.

The fixtures in ``_rar_fixtures.py`` are built byte by byte (no RAR tool exists
here). They are validated against rarfile's own independent parser before they
are used to test this pipeline, so the tests do not merely assert that our code
agrees with our own generator.
