"""Dynamic work ledger for real-time processing progress.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Progress used to be a pair of integers on ``IntegratedFileReader``
(``_processing_stats['total']`` / ``['completed']``). That model is only
correct for a flat folder of top-level files, and the pipeline is not flat:

* ``total`` was set once, in ``process_folder()``, from ``read_tree()`` - so it
  only ever counted files visible on the filesystem before processing began.
  Archive members, email attachments and embedded Office/OpenDocument objects
  are materialised *later*, by a reader, and never entered the denominator.
* Nested children are processed by a **second** ``IntegratedFileReader`` built
  inside ``FileRouterService._process_extracted_files()``. That reader had its
  own private counters and no ``progress_callback``, so every nested file was
  invisible to the job the user was watching.
* ``completed`` was incremented in the *join* loop of ``_process_with_threads``,
  which joins threads in submission order. One slow container in slot 0 held
  the counter at 0 even after every other worker had finished.

The net effect was the reported symptom: 0% for the entire run, then a jump to
100%.

This ledger replaces those counters with a single shared, thread-safe record of
work that **grows as containers are opened**. One ledger per user-visible job;
it is handed down the processing chain exactly the way ``storage_pipeline``
already is, so parents and children account into the same denominator.

ACCOUNTING RULES
----------------
1. *Discovery* adds work: ``add_discovered(n, key=...)``. ``key`` makes
   discovery idempotent - the router registers an extraction directory when it
   finds it, and the nested reader re-registers the same directory with its
   post-checkpoint count; the second call reconciles the difference instead of
   double-counting.
2. *Every* unit that enters the pipeline is opened with ``begin()`` and closed
   exactly once with ``WorkUnit.settle(outcome)``. Settlement is idempotent, so
   a worker that is abandoned on timeout and later finishes anyway cannot be
   counted twice.
3. Terminal outcomes are ``completed``, ``failed``, ``skipped``,
   ``unsupported`` and ``retryable``. All five advance the bar - a skipped or
   unsupported object is still finished work, and hiding it would strand the
   indicator below 100% forever. ``retryable`` (timeouts, transient connection
   errors) is tracked in its own bucket so the UI can tell "done" from
   "worth another attempt" without losing it from the denominator.
4. ``percent`` is ``terminal / discovered``. It is 0 only when nothing has
   finished, and 100 only when nothing is left outstanding.

Deliberately *not* implemented: a process-wide "current ledger" fallback. With
``JOBS_MAX_CONCURRENT > 1`` a global would silently merge unrelated jobs, so
propagation is explicit and a reader that is not given a ledger accounts into
its own.
