"""The Experience Contract as a read-only surface.

Three questions, three answers, all generated from the sources of truth that
already exist - the interface registry, the declared screen definitions and the
translation catalogs:

* ``/api/experience/contracts`` - every screen's contract: identity, navigation,
  actions, columns, filters, states, help, shortcuts, layout and the translation
  keys it needs;
* ``/api/experience/contracts/<interface_id>`` - one screen, for the inspector;
* ``/api/experience/coverage`` - what is translated, per language and per
  screen, measured from the catalogs rather than estimated.

Read-only on purpose, and the reason is the same one the registry API states:
*reading* a contract is safe, and the write side is an administrative action
that has to validate, version, preview and audit itself. That side is the
Experience Studio, and until it exists these endpoints report the current state
of the experience rather than pretending to configure it.
