"""Analysis kinds and declared analyses.

An **analysis kind** is reviewed code: which dataset roles it reads (with the
columns and row-limit semantics it requires), how it computes its measures
from those rows (``core.analytics.measures``), which thresholds interpret
them (``core.analytics.thresholds``) and which narrative template set speaks
for it (``core.analytics.narrative``).

A declared **analysis** (``Analysis``) binds a kind to concrete dataset keys.
Reports list analyses by key (``id@version``); the runner computes them from
the dataset rows it has just read in the run's single snapshot, so an
analysis never queries the database and is reproducible from the stored
dataset rows alone.

States: ``measured`` or ``not_measurable`` (with a reason). An analysis never
reports a number it did not measure; "not measurable" is a narrative of its
own, not zeros.

# coverage (step 23, the Comprehensive report's supporting section)
#
# How far the stored keywords and categories reach into the matched contents.
# The keywords and categories come from the whole collection; their reach is
# counted only inside the matched set, so an absent keyword is a listed zero,
# never a missing row. The overview's exact counts are cross-checked against
# each listing's own copy of the matched-set size, and a disagreement fails
# the run (the same discipline keyness applies to its G2 columns). Category
# shares are not a partition (categories share words), so no concentration
# index is computed here - an HHI over overlapping shares would state more
# than the data supports.
