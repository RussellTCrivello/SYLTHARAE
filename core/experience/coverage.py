"""Translation coverage, measured from the catalogs that actually ship.

The rule this module exists to keep: a coverage figure is a measurement, never
a score. There is no ``92/100`` anywhere, because a number like that cannot be
acted on. What is reported instead is what is true of a catalog and a screen:

* **translated** - the key or its source string has a translation in that
  language;
* **missing** - it has none, so the reader sees English;
* **fallback** - the translation exists but is identical to the source string,
  which usually means "not really translated";
* **source** - the string that is shown when nothing else can be.

Two catalogs exist in this product and both are read, because the frontend
runtime reads both: the Babel catalogs under ``translations/<lang>`` for
server-rendered text, and the JavaScript UI packs under
``static/js/i18n/locales`` for strings that only exist in client code. A
language's coverage is the union - anything that measured only one of the two
would report a number the reader can see to be wrong.

The contract's semantic keys (``screen.files.title``) are looked up by key
first and by their English source string second, because the catalogs still key
by source string today. That second lookup is what makes the number useful now
rather than after a migration nobody has started; the gap between the two is
reported as ``keyed`` versus ``by_source`` so progress is visible.
