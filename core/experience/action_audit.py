"""The action surface audit: what a person can do, and where it is done today.

Read-only and generated, like the rest of ``core/experience``. It answers the
question the Action Registry has to answer before it can exist: *which actions
does this product actually offer, what does each apply to, and which of them
cannot be described honestly by the model we have?*

Four measurements, none of them typed by hand:

* **The registry** (``action_registry.py``): every registered action, with the
  scope, permission, confirmation and operation reference it declares.
* **The surfaces the templates still carry** - shared toolbar, hand-written
  bars, record-row actions, browser ``confirm()`` dialogs, viewer controls,
  page-local button state. Every scan is stated once and used for both the
  count and the file list, so the number and the evidence cannot disagree.
* **What the registry itself is missing** - actions with no operation, and
  screens nobody has described - counted, not glossed over.
* **The gaps**: the short, curated list of actions whose behaviour the current
  model cannot say. Each entry names the code that proves it, and the test
  checks that the anchor still exists - so the list cannot quietly turn into
  opinion, and a fixed gap disappears from it instead of lingering.

Nothing here performs an action or changes a screen. The audit is the agenda
for the next layer, and it says out loud which screens nobody has described
yet instead of implying every screen has been designed.
