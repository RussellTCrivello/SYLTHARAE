"""The disclosure register: every file that leaves the system is recorded.

``DATA_EXPORTED`` is written to ``audit_log`` for **every** response that
hands the client a file (``Content-Disposition: attachment``), from whichever
route produced it - search exports, bulk file exports, keyword and category
exports, backups, original-file downloads, and report artifacts. Coverage is
enforced centrally by an ``after_request`` hook rather than by remembering to
call a helper in each route, so a new export route cannot be added unaudited.

Routes enrich the record with what only they know (scope, row count, the
criteria fingerprint, truncation) via :func:`note_disclosure`.

The hook **fails closed**: if the audit record cannot be written, the export
is replaced with ``503 disclosure_audit_failed``. "What left this system, and
who took it?" is the one question this installation must never be unable to
answer, so an unrecordable disclosure is refused rather than allowed.

Measured, not assumed: the artifact's byte size and SHA-256 are computed from
the bytes actually sent when they can be read without streaming a huge file
into memory. When they cannot, the record says ``"sha256": null`` with the
reason - never a fabricated digest.
