    The name is derived from the source file's *absolute* path, so it is:

    * **stable** - the same source file always maps to the same folder, which
      makes extraction idempotent and lets a retry reuse that location;
    * **O(1)** - the previous implementation searched for a free numeric suffix
      with ``while extract_to.exists()``, so with N folders already sharing a
      name it performed N ``stat`` calls to mint folder N+1. Corpora routinely
      contain thousands of archives with the same basename (``data.zip``,
      ``report.zip``), which made this quadratic in the number of archives -
      billions of syscalls over a multi-million-file run;
    * **unique per source file** - a digest of the absolute path keeps two
      same-named archives in different directories apart, which is the property
      the numeric suffix was protecting.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the source file.
        extension: Optional extension to strip from the name. An empty string
            means "no extension to strip" (``Path.stem``), which is what
