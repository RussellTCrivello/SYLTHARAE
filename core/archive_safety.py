"""Safe archive extraction (SEC-05).

Hardening applied to every archive reader (ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, RAR, 7z):

* Rejection of absolute paths, ``..`` traversal, drive-qualified and UNC paths.
* Every destination is re-validated to resolve beneath the extraction root
  after normalisation (zip-slip / tar-slip / symlink escapes).
* Symlinks and hard links are refused (they cannot be validated statically).
* Resource limits: maximum depth, maximum member count, maximum extracted
  bytes, maximum compression ratio, per-file size limit and a wall-clock
  timeout.
* No ``extractall`` anywhere: members are streamed one at a time.

# so an operator who *has* a decoder installed still gets ``RarCannotExec``.
#
# rarfile's own probe is not a capability check - it accepts anything that
# answers ``bsdtar --version`` or ``7z i`` - so a decoder is only configured
# here after it has been observed to support RAR. GNU tar answers
# ``--version`` too and cannot read RAR at all; configuring it would turn a
