"""The interface registry: the one description of what SYLTHARAE offers.

This module replaces ``INTERFACE_METADATA`` - the untyped dictionary that used
to describe interface switches inside the settings adapter, listing endpoints
that did not exist, a page-less switch and two entries for one page. The
registry is a declaration: it says what exists, what it is for, who should see
it, what it needs and where it lives. It owns no logic beyond looking itself up
(``validation.py`` checks it, ``settings/interface_state.py`` applies stored
state to it, the application reads it).

Three rules keep it honest, and each is enforced by a test rather than a
convention:

* **It refers, it does not duplicate.** Routes are endpoint *names* verified
  against the live URL map; settings are ``category.key`` *references*
  verified against the settings model; roles are names verified against
  ``core/security``. The registry never holds a second copy of any of them.
* **It never authorises.** ``required_role`` decides what is *shown*.
  ``core/security`` decides what is *allowed*, and it is untouched by this
  module (see ``docs/INTERFACE_REGISTRY.md``).
* **Defaults live here and nowhere else.** The old code had two: a hard-coded
  dictionary that enabled everything on reset, and a getter that returned
  False for ids it did not know. ``default_enabled`` is the single answer.

The endpoint inventory in ``inventory.py`` is the factual list of what the
application actually serves; a coverage test requires every user-facing page in
it to be owned by exactly one entry below.

#:   now the ingestion surface. The ids change; stored choices follow them.
#: * **merges** - ``file_browser`` was the same page as ``file_library``, and
#:   ``advanced_search`` was one of the modes of ``search``. One interface, two
#:   settings keys.
#:
#: ``analytics`` pointed at an endpoint that does not exist (checked against
#: the live URL map), so it gated nothing; the reporting overview is what it
#: described, and a stored choice about analytics is honoured there.
