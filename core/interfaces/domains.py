"""Application domains - what part of the work an interface belongs to.

A domain is the *operator's* grouping of the product, not a database schema and
not a settings category. It answers "what is this for?" so that navigation,
permissions, help and setting screens can all be organised the same way, and so
that nobody has to guess whether "Analyst Categories" is a discovery tool or an
analysis tool.

Every interface belongs to exactly one domain. The set is closed: a new domain
is a deliberate product decision, made here, not a string invented at a call
site. :func:`validate_registry` enforces that.

The information model itself is documented alongside these domains in
``docs/DOMAIN_MODEL.md`` (Source → Side → Hash → Path → Content → Analysis …
plus the analyst layer) - the domains here are the *work surface*, the model
there is the *data substrate*.
