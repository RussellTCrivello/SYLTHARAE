"""The endpoint inventory, generated from the application itself.

Counts of "how many pages does SYLTHARAE have" must not be maintained by hand;
they go stale the moment somebody adds a route, and a stale count is how the
productization map ended up disagreeing with itself. This module asks Flask.

``build_inventory(app)`` walks ``app.url_map.iter_rules()`` and classifies every
endpoint into exactly one bucket:

``USER_INTERFACE``
    A page a person navigates to. Must be owned by an interface in the
    registry - the coverage test fails on an unowned one, and the request gate
    refuses to serve it.
``INTERNAL_PAGE``
    A page the product needs but does not advertise (diagnostics).
``SYSTEM_ENDPOINT``
    Infrastructure: authentication, setup, health, cookies, locale, favicon.
    Never gated by an interface switch and never in navigation.
``ACTION``
    A non-GET endpoint on the application's own pages (delete, upload control).
    Owned by the interface whose page triggers it.
``REDIRECT``
    A route that only exists to keep an old address working.
``API_ENDPOINT``
    A programming surface, not a page (normally under ``/api/...``; a small
    explicit set of legacy JSON routes lives outside that prefix).

The classification is deterministic and its exception lists are declared here,
in the open, so "internal" is a decision somebody made rather than a bucket
things fall into. Endpoints classified as USER_INTERFACE must all be owned; the
rest are allowed to be unowned, because they are not part of the product
surface.
