"""Stored interface state, applied to the registry.

The registry says what exists. This module says what is switched on for this
installation, and answers the questions the rest of the application asks -
"is this enabled?", "does the operator see it?", "may it be switched off?" -
by combining the two.

Three boundaries are load-bearing:

* **Defaults come from the registry.** There is no second list of defaults, and
  enabling everything on reset is gone: an interface whose registry default is
  off stays off when settings are reset.
* **Unknown means off.** An id the registry does not declare - a typo, a
  retired switch, a settings file from an older version - is not enabled,
  however it is stored. It is never deleted from the file; it simply cannot
  turn anything on.
* **Visibility is not authorisation.** ``is_visible`` decides whether an
  operator is *shown* an interface. Every request is still authorised
  server-side by ``core/security``; nothing here may be used as a gate on its
  own (see ``docs/INTERFACE_REGISTRY.md``).

Dependency policy: the registry says what an interface needs. Rather than
silently mutating an operator's choices, this module refuses new invalid states
and reports existing ones - ``state_report()`` is what the interfaces view and
the tests read.
