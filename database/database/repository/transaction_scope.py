"""
Context-local transaction binding shared by a group of repositories.

Why this exists
---------------
Repository objects are long-lived and shared.  ``ContentDBService`` builds one
instance per table and the ingestion pipeline drives those same instances from
several worker threads at once (``IntegratedFileReader._process_with_threads``
starts one managed thread per file, and all of them store through the single
``StoragePipeline.db_service``).

A transaction therefore cannot be represented by mutating repository
attributes.  The previous implementation replaced ``service.<repo>`` with
connection-bound clones for the duration of a transaction; with two threads
inside ``process_full_document`` at the same time, thread B's clone assignment
overwrote thread A's, and thread A's next statement ran on thread B's
connection.  The visible symptoms were exactly the production failures:

* ``relation "tmp_words" does not exist`` - the temporary table is a
  per-*session* object; it was created on one connection and read on another;
* ``no COPY in progress`` and ``server sent data ("D" message) without prior
  row description ("T" message)`` - two threads driving COPY on one session;
* ``current transaction is aborted`` cascades, followed by foreign key
  violations against rows whose transaction had been rolled back.

:class:`TransactionScope` keeps the binding in a :class:`contextvars.ContextVar`
instead.  Every thread (and every asyncio task) sees its own connection, nested
``with`` blocks stack, and the previous value is restored when the block exits.
No shared object is mutated, so the repositories stay safe to share.
